If I were to summarize Himanatu it would probably be with these two lines that flash briefly in the opening movie. I
think this captures the core of the work well and even if it seems simple and trite I think good fiction has a way of
making the trite feel profound.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://vndb.org/v10557">Himawari no Kyoukai to Nagai Natuyasumi</a> is (primarily) a collaboration between two of my favorite writers, SCA-DI and
Konno Asta. If I remember correctly the backstory is that SCA-DI read Konno’s first game, <a href="https://vndb.org/v1898">Natu no Ame</a>, and sought him
out for a collaboration (I don’t remember where I read this so take it with a grain of salt). As a huge fan of both
SCA-DI and Konno’s other work I had to check this game out eventually but I was still surprised by how much I liked it.
I think this game is an extremely overlooked entry in Makura’s catalogue.
</p>

<p>
I only read the main routes by SCA-DI and Konno; the side writer routes don’t really interest me too much but one of the
side heroines is pretty cute. I’m a little interested in the additional route that came with the PS3 release; Hina’s
route made it so that depending on where that branches off it could be pretty interesting and I might check it out
eventually. I assume it’s one of the side writers though.
</p>

<p>
The game is very heavily themed around sunflowers. This is more justification for my theory that sunflower media can’t
possibly be bad, plus <postlink slug="asteraceae">sunflowers are my favorite plant</postlink>.

<h2 id="orgb471cd8"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Common route</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Seemingly contrary to most other reviews I’ve seen of this game, I liked the common route quite a bit. I think it’s
pretty effective at establishing its atmosphere (the music and art certainly help with this), it’s surprisingly funny,
the girls are cute and characterized pretty well, and it has a few really nice lines that set the tone thematically for
what the game is about. If anything the weakness is the last part, as I think the rest of the game was not very focused
on what I thought the common route was setting up for.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>I think it builds a really nice atmosphere around Obosiro.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The common route is simple enough; the main character (Asitaba Yousuke) returns to the village he grew up in after
having moved away 8 years ago, reunites with his childhood friends, and together they work on restoring the 秘密基地
they used to use. This could have been a pretty nice group of friends/club activities/DIY story, and to a certain extent
it was, but I think it was a bit too short and unfocused to really get the ball moving in that regard. This is perhaps
my biggest gripe with the game; if the common route were maybe 50% longer I think I could have gotten really into it.
Still, what was there was pretty good.
</p>

<p>
There is quite a lot unexplained regarding the circumstances surrounding Yousuke, why he came to the village originally,
and why he left and then came back. Also, one of the heroines is pretty mysterious and a lot of the scenes with her feel
a bit surreal and magical. I thought it did a pretty good job of keeping the mysterious tension in place while not
actually being a mystery game; it provided enough to keep you interested and to establish an element of magical realism
in the setting.
</p>

<p>
I’m pretty sure SCA-DI wrote, while not the entire common route, significant portions of the common route himself. Some
parts felt a little like a proto-Sakura no Uta to me at times; especially there were a a few scattered conversations and
narration that reminded me a lot of the end of Sakuuta chapter 2. I personally really like the way Sakuuta handles
change and the passage of time and the ephemeral nature of all worldly phenomena so this set my hopes for the rest of
the game pretty high. Some scenes like when Yousuke and Yomi were talking about 懐かしい would not have felt out of
place as a conversation between Naoya and Rin in the early parts of Sakuuta.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
「難しいな。変わってないようで、すべてがゆっくりと変わっている……こんな感覚をどう言えばいいのか……」
</p>

<p>
「なつかしい……」
</p>

<p>
「懐かしい……？」
</p>

<p>
「うん……わたしは、そういう単純な言葉でいいんだと思う」
</p>
</blockquote>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>There are some other quotes later on that made me think similar things, e.g. near the end of Yomi’s route:</summary>
<blockquote>
<p>
「そうだよ。ここは、私達、朧白聖歌隊の秘密基地なんだから、最後の最後まで、楽しく過ごすんだよ。終わりなんて考えないで……終わりの日の事なんて考えないで……」
</p>

<p>
「そうだね……」
</p>

<p>
たしかに時間の問題ではない。
</p>

<p>
どんなに残りの時間が短く感じられたとしても、俺たちはその最後の瞬間まで、この教会の朧白聖歌隊だ。
</p>

Or the entire scene at the end of the common route:

</p>
</figure>
</details>

<p>
The SCA-DI contribution also showed through in the humor, and while I’m not typically a huge fan of SCA-DI humor I
thought it was actually pretty funny at times, like the better parts of Sakuuta chapter 1 without the parts that annoyed
me so much.

<div id="outline-container-orgde5d07b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgde5d07b"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Yomi route</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This to me is the real emotional payload of the game. I was blown away at how good it is. In my opinion Yomi’s route
stands as one of the best things SCA-DI has ever written, on par with some of the best parts of Sakura no Uta/Sakura no
Toki/Subarasiki Hibi/Tui no Sora Remake for me. I definitely did not expect this to deliver the feels it did.
</p>

<p>
The only thing that was not completely satisfying is that I felt like it kind of abandoned the passage of time themes
that the common route was hinting at. The epilogue did an alright job of circling back to this but it was shown more in
platitudes than in the actual events of the story.
</p>

<p>
As kind of a personal soft spot I really like how it focused on the power and versatility of words and human language.
The way this was done was really cute and in my opinion responsible for some of the most beautiful lines in the story.
When SCA-DI enters the zone he can really put out some truly beautiful usage of the Japanese language and he really
delivered on that here.
</p>

<p>
The overall structure of (the main part of anyway, see below) this route is really clever. It’s really tightly paced and
does an excellent job of setting up the background information necessary for its reveals in a way that feels really
natural. Honestly it’s just extremely well plotted. Between this route and Yasuko’s route in Tui no Sora Remake I think
SCA-DI is an extremely talented writer of short stories and I would like to see him pursue this kind of thing more in
the future.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Big spoilers</summary>
<p>
The type of recontextualization this route does can be an extremely powerful tool. After the reveals I was crying so
much just thinking about how she only ate fish and how he tried to catch fish for her when they were on the island… he
just wanted to catch fish for his cat man… fuck.
</p>
</details>

<p>
I also think the usage of folklore in this route is really nice. The way it’s presented is pretty cool; the blend of
actual Japanese folklore and the parts invented for the story reminded me of Syumon Yuu’s works a bit. The way the
folklore unfolds as they dig deeper into the mystery is really engaging and keeps you reading. I really enjoyed the
particular brand of magical realism in this game and how it was kind of grounded in the folklore.
</p>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Even the way the sunflowers are drawn in this route just feels kind of magical. Incidentally, this route has SO many really nice CGs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
No discussion of the Himanatu routes can be complete without commenting on the really bizarre structure. There are no H
scenes in the main part of the routes, rather, it’s all packed into the post-credits section, and the post-credits is
like ⅓ of the total length of Yomi’s route. Given how epic the actual pre-credits conclusion of Yomi’s route is, this
really took some wind out of the sails. The H scenes weren’t bad, but they weren’t really good either and I think they
would have benefited from not being all back to back since it did become a bit of a slog to read through. The other
parts of the post-credits epilogue were fine; some were nice enough but felt a bit extraneous and then as mentioned the
rest served to connect back to the common route passage of time theme a bit.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Big spoilers</summary>
<p>
I’m particularly referring to the parts with original Yomi’s mother. I can see why this exists and it was something that
I did wonder about, but I don’t think it needed to be addressed explicitly. It almost felt a little TOO conclusive in a
way and I don’t really think the story would have been harmed by leaving it to the imagination. It also got brought up
and then resolved really quickly. If the rest of the post-credits section had also been about original Yomi’s family I
could see it working a bit better, but you have the epic climax into credits roll, then H scene spam mixed with light
slice of life, then another ending fake out, then the sudden pivot into how Yomi will literally evaporate if she doesn’t
meet the original Yomi’s family to solidify their connections, then the quick resolution and then the actual end. It was
fine, but it was also just kind of weird. Between all this there were some fairly nice feelsgood lines at least.
</p>

<p>
In some sense though this does serve a meta-purpose in giving the reader some time to cool down after how high the
emotions were running during the main part of Yomi’s route. I actually like that and it makes it easier to transition to
the next route, but I think the way this was done was maybe a bit too jarring and it lost some of the kami momentum it
had built up.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf2359f7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf2359f7"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Hina route</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
This is the part by Konno Asta. Hina’s route is probably one of the weirder/more unique/more ambitious pure romance
stories I’ve read in an eroge, both due to the nature of the relationship that it tackles and the way it gets there. I
think it showcases both Konno’s strengths and weaknesses as a writer pretty well.
</p>

<p>
Konno has a certain way of grabbing you by the balls with drama and not letting go. Things are happening, emotions are
running high, and you’re along for the ride. In my opinion there aren’t too many writers who can match his
moment-to-moment execution of scenes and ability to get you emotionally invested in pretty much anything. I spent the
last 2 days I was reading this game doing pretty much nothing except reading all day because at that point I really just
couldn’t stop. Konno can completely sell you on the cheesiest scenes and make you really believe in them.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand the actual planning was sometimes kind of strange. It doesn’t feel extremely tight, and some events do
kind of feel like asspulls just to keep the drama going, but when you’re in the moment you just kinda BELIEVE and roll
with it. In the end it really does come together. There were a lot of times I was questioning the characters’
motivations only to eventually be satisfied later on. I kept wondering how it was actually going to wrap everything up
and yet somehow by the end everything does feel resolved (mostly). Even if the drama occasionally feels a bit contrived
or comes off a bit thick the resolutions never fail to leave you with a big smile on your face. Towards the end there’s
a real sense of like, this is what we’ve been building up to all this time and it’s finally all paying off, and some
scenes are kind of magical in how much it pulls you into them.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Spoilers</summary>
<p>
Specifically I think the entire plotline with Hina’s mother and Kuroi was kind of more complex than it needed to be.
There’s enough going on in the route just with the relationship between Hina and Yousuke and I feel like it kinda
overcooked with the corporate intrigue plotline. It’s one of those things where I think emotionally it benefits from
drawing out the resolution to Hina’s backstory, but the actual process of drawing it out makes the plot a bit overly
circuitous. It’s executed well enough that it works, but in my opinion the actual plot is kind of weird.
</p>
</details>

<p>
Even though the route is already quite long (I think Hina’s route is about as long as the common route + Yomi route
combined) I felt like it should have either been a bit longer or a bit shorter. If it was longer maybe it could have
tackled some arcs in a bit more depth; if it was shorter maybe those parts would just have been cut in the first place.
It definitely covers a <i>lot</i> of ground, which I think is mostly a good thing because it makes it a more compelling
romance story. And this is definitely what I would consider to be a good <i>romance</i> story, with both parties taking the
time to figure out what it is they feel, the back and forth, etc. It’s definitely a cut above the romance in most eroge
routes, which I think can often feel fairly unmotivated. Hina’s route certainly does not skimp on both <i>why</i> they ended
up falling for each other and the circuitous process they took for it to be fully realized.
</p>

<p>
Tonally I think Hina’s route feels pretty different from the common route + Yomi’s route (which keep a pretty consistent
tone) and it results in something that doesn’t quite feel fully cohesive to me. It’s easy to not really notice this in
the moment but when you’re thinking back to Yomi’s route it feels like a pretty different game entirely. Honestly this
almost works as a sort of meta aspect—the tone shift is a marking of the passage of time that the game is going for. But
in the end the routes just feel very different, for better or worse.
</p>

<p>
The MC also feels really different between the routes. This isn’t really helped by the fact that different routes have
different artists and they drew the MC’s face pretty differently in CGs, so he looks kind of different too. I’m not
exactly sure how to say this but he feels kind of… dumber… in Hina’s route. In Yomi’s route he’s mostly pretty
thoughtful, almost a bit timid, and generally feels like he seeks understanding and thinks before he acts. He’s not
completely generic but doesn’t feel too remarkable either. In Hina’s route he is definitely more fiery and headstrong
and comes off as having a much stronger personality in general. Like, he feels like much more of a character, but also
part of that is that you get kind of exasperated at him sometimes, or at least I did. I expect he is probably a bit more
polarizing than anything in Yomi’s route and I could see him kind of annoying some people but I feel like getting a
little bit mad at the MC from time to time can kind of get you more engaged in the story, in a way. I consider this more
of a pro than a con but the difference in the portrayal of the MC is another thing that makes the routes feel pretty
different from each other.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Spoilers</summary>
<p>
For example I thought Yousuke getting in a fistfight with Kuroi for no reason was pretty bizarre. That single thing
changed my impression of the MC a lot after Yomi’s route, since Yomi route MC would never have done that. I was a little
mad at the MC for that when it happened, and for his entire handling of the whole encounter with Hina’s mother the first
time around. In the end though I liked the way this worked out because it felt like the portrayal of Yousuke was much
more developed psychologically than it was in Yomi’s route, which is true of basically all the characters.
</p>
</details>

<p>
I think there’s also an interesting contrast between how SCA-DI and Konno write heroines. Konno writes these really
realistic, psychologically complex and really cute heroines and SCA-DI writes these kind of magical, almost ethereal
feeling heroines. Yomi is like, definitely a SCA-DI girl, if you’ve read any prior SCA-DI works it’s immediately obvious
from the very start of the game. One of the most SCA-DI coded heroines of all time.
</p>

<p>
Hina is a pretty realistic (albeit very understanding and kind) adolescent girl. There are many scenes from her
perspective and her internal thought process is pretty well developed. It’s messy and complex and sometimes
contradictory; she has insecurities that are at once both irrational and kind of realistic.
</p>

<p>
In contrast Yomi’s motivations are very simple and pure. Even more than saying <i>she</i> is idealistic I would say <i>the
concept of her existence</i> is idealistic, whereas Hina is a much more grounded attempt to portray a realistic girl. As a
consequence of this I think Hina is really cute and lovable and her route is a good romance story whereas Yomi serves to
make the concept of her route possible and lets it deliver something really epic. They both serve the purposes of their
routes really well. I don’t think one style of writing heroines is any better than the other; Hina is certainly the
cuter girl that will have you kyaaaing at the screen more but Yomi will stick with me for a long, long time. It just got
me thinking about different styles of writing heroines since I think SCA-DI and Konno are definitely on opposite ends of
some kind of spectrum here.
</p>

<p>
I like the usage of Hina’s perspective a lot and the scenes where she’s just talking to Itiko or to Tukiko flesh out her
character a lot in my opinion. Her narration goes a long way toward helping you understand how her thought process works
and it makes some of the later scenes hit pretty hard. Itiko is also pretty funny.
</p>

<p>
Hina’s route does the same thing as Yomi’s route with all the H scenes stuffed into the post-credits; it doesn’t feel
quite as egregious or disruptive here but it’s still a bit of a slog to get through. I think the Hina epilogue is really
nice though, a fitting end to the game and it finally comes back to deliver on some of the thematic direction hinted at
by the common route.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Big spoilers</summary>
<p>
The major thing about this route that does bother me is how Yomi was handled, i.e. basically written out of the game.
After Yomi’s route I was wondering what they could possibly do with her in Hina’s route given how hard it would be to
follow up Yomi’s route but I still didn’t really expect them to just kind of give up. To be fair, the scene where Yomi
turns back into a cat was pretty moving even if it felt like it kind of came out of nowhere, but also removing her human
form from their memories was a bit much and felt like a blatant attempt to just kind of dodge the problem entirely and
not have to deal with it. It’s also really sad, too, and I guess the sporadic discussions later in the route between
Yousuke and Ruka where they <i>almost</i> remember Yomi are an attempt to ease the pain by reminding the reader that she’s
not entirely forgotten, but mostly it just kind of baited me into thinking there might be more of a real resolution to
that, which didn’t happen. This is the one thing I would say is just not really resolved adequately at all. I think most
people who read this game will probably think the same thing, since frankly it does just feel kind of half-assed, but in
a way they kind of wrote themselves into a corner with how epic Yomi’s route was and then having to follow it up with
another one that’s not about that.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately it’s just another example of the routes wanting to do pretty different things, but since Yomi’s route
recontextualizes the common route it forces Hina’s route to do something about her. I think it could have done better,
but I’m not exactly mad about it due to how well Yomi was handled in her own route. Yomi’s route was so final to her
story that I kind of don’t mind that much that they didn’t even really try for Hina’s route.
</p>

<p>
You can of course just headcanon it as Yomi deciding to become the 寝子麗, which I guess is what happened, but that
entails the original Yomi losing her bet with Nana, which is… kind of awkward a thing to have happen in the true route I
feel.
</p>

<p>
It does make all the scenes with her watching over them as a cat very bittersweet.
</p>
</details>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Spoilers</summary>
<p>
In spite of selling me pretty well on the romance between the two leads, the exact nature of their relationship is still
kind of weird to me. There’s a certain amount of papering over the fact that she’s still literally in high school and
they’re getting married (but fake but real). I think this could have been addressed more since the speed of it at the
end does take me out of the otherwise realistic feel of the route a little bit. I think this is something that has
gotten better as time passes after finishing and as I think about it though; I think the pivot from viewing her as more
of a daughter to more of a wife was pretty smooth. It is at least a pretty weird relationship but it works surprisingly
well somehow.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
I can’t believe I’ve gotten this far without mentioning the music. I think this game probably has the best OST of any
eroge I’ve played or at least it’s up there. Szak is obviously one of the best composers in the industry and I think
this stands among his finest work. There’s good synergy between the music and the text and I think it really makes a lot
of scenes even more powerful.
</p>

<p>
In spite of having a bunch of different artists I think the art + music + text + voice acting all comes together to form
a pretty cohesive atmosphere. It’s very strong as a Gesamtkunstwerk and the unifying motif of sunflowers helps out a
lot.
</p>

<p>
The art itself is kind of hit or miss though. I think the BGs are all very nice but the tatie and CGs span the full
range from top tier to not so great. Hina has by far the best tatie in the game, as expected since Moto4 is my favorite
Makura artist. The CGs are pretty good by and large; sometimes a bit janky but the visual direction is always strong. As
with other Makura games you won’t find many CGs that are just tilted zoomed in close ups of a heroine’s upper body. I
think a lot of the CG composition is extremely good. Oh yeah, and it has back sprites, always the mark of a kamige. And
naked sprites. And even naked back sprites.

Ruka is very moe. I love Kawasima Rino’s voice acting very much. I think she really nails it on this character.
</p>

<p>
Wrapping this all back up, I think one of the most interesting things about the game to me, having been given some time
to think about it, is the way it ultimately handles 変わってゆくもの / 変わらないもの. This is a bit difficult to
discuss without spoilers.
</p>

<details class="spoiler status-field-border"><summary>Spoilers</summary>
<p>
Originally I thought I would have preferred if they did lose the church and the second part of Hina’s route took place
somewhere else (either still in Obosiro or elsewhere). This would be sad, but it could have used this to show how
Yousuke and Hina can forge ahead in spite of losing an important place filled with memories. As it is, they didn’t
really lose anything. Yes, the bell was removed. Yes, people moved away and they don’t talk as much anymore. But the
bell was brought back when it counted and rather than gradually drifting apart from Ruka and Dia they’re still pretty
close and they can always come back like family.
</p>

<p>
And I think maybe this actually is the point of the game. In addition to ephemeral things there are also some things
that don’t change and some relationships that always stay around. I think this conveniently integrates the family themes
of Hina’s route with the passage of time focus of the common route and epilogues.
</p>

<p>
Simply put, after the common route I was expecting the message about the passage of time to be something like “It’s okay
to go into the future, in spite of the ephemeral things you will inevitably lose, because there are new things too.” But
it was actually something more like “Don’t be afraid of the future, because there are some things that you won’t leave
behind, some things that will always be there or will always come back. The sunflowers only bloom for a few months each
year, but they come back year after year.”
</p>
</details>

<p>
This is something I had to think about a little bit to really get and I think my interpretation is still evolving. But
the angle it took is growing on me quite a bit, and I think this was the one coherent aspect throughout a work that
otherwise goes in several very different directions.
</p>

<p>
Very early on in the game after Yousuke returns to the village he comments on the fact that the church bell tower that
seemed so big to him as a kid is actually pretty small now as an adult.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The priest: 「時が経つとはそういうことだ。」
</p>

<p>
Yousuke: 「永遠のものはないってことですか」

Indeed, obviously there isn’t anything truly eternal. But don’t let that make you overlook the things that are close,
the things that are cyclic, the things that operate on their own schedule entirely unconcerned with your life. This is,
in my opinion, what the himawari stood for the whole time, and what Obosiro as a whole stands for. There’s that passage
from the opening that repeats again throughout the game:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
地に咲く太陽の季節は、わずか６０日あまり。
</p>

<p>
１年を２４時間に置き換えるなら、向日葵の太陽が姿を見せられるのは、ほんの４時間程度ということになる。
</p>

<p>
けれど――季節は廻り、夏はまた還ってくる。
</p>

<p>
この土地の生命が枯れない限り、何度でも向日葵は咲き誇る。

Sunflowers are annual plants that die every year, but they can grow again. There is always the 希望 that they will be
back next year, even after your 長い夏休み ends.

I can see myself thinking about this game for a long time to come. I think I read it at a good time in my life for the
message it has and I got super absorbed into it. Both of the routes are really pretty unique among eroge that I’ve read
and they’re very memorable. Great game.
