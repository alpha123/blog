* Ⅰ.
I have a bunch of story ideas in my head. Sometimes I come up with new ones; usually they’re bad and I forget about them
shortly after, but sometimes if they stick around for years I tend to think maybe they have potential. I have delusions
of writing them eventually.

Sometimes when I watch or read something by a pretty well-known writer where it’s clear that they most likely didn’t
propose the project but were contracted by someone else I wonder what made them accept, what story idea they had that
they thought this would be a good avenue to get out. My impression of the process is, you know, maybe Maruto has a bunch
of ideas, different core concepts you can build a story around, floating around in his head for months or years and then
some anime production committee contacts him with some basic outline and asks if he wants to take the project and maybe
he thinks this would be a good outlet for some idea he has and accepts.

My mindset for a lot of the first half or so of Classroom☆Crisis was wondering what idea Maruto had when he agreed to
take this project. By the end I think it really delivers on this a lot. There actually is a really cool story concept
here; I have no idea if my flight of fancy is true and it was something Maruto had been marinating for a while or if he
just came up with it, but anyway I think there’s a really good concept here.

Unfortunately it is pretty much only a concept.

Because this isn’t really a popular or well-remembered show, as a refresher the C☆C plot is basically

There’s a big aerospace company which was founded as a collaboration between two families. There’s some internal
politicking over control of the company and one family has mostly seized control and displaced the other, but not fully.

The MC, Nagisa, is just a body double for one of the main girls, Iris, who is the actual Nagisa and the heir to the
waning family. The more powerful family wants her gone so they can take over completely, and MC has a vow to protect
her. The real Nagisa’s parents die in an accident (implied to be an assassination) and the more powerful family tries to
adopt her so they can keep her under their control, but the MC switches places with her and they get him instead. The
real Nagisa is then exfiltrated to Earth but gets in an accident en route between Mars and Earth and is presumed dead,
but she survived though it left her with complete amnesia about all of this and believes her name to be Iris.

The MC meanwhile is raised (highly abusively) as part of the main family, but his older brother hates his guts and only
assigns him jobs in the company that should be complete failures, but he keeps turning them around. The show starts when
he gets assigned to the hybrid high-school-slash-experimental-rocket-engine-R&D division run by a brilliant
engineer/teacher and his high school students including his younger sister Mizuki.

Towards the latter parts of the show Iris starts to remember what happened after encountering the MC again. The drama,
which is essentially only implicit, is that Iris falls in love with the MC for saving her but Mizuki (who is her best
friend, and basically the thing she lives for while she has amnesia) already loves him.

Mizuki has no backstory that connects her with the rest of the plot and I don’t think it’s ever mentioned how Iris met
her in the first place or why she loves her so much, but she’s super cute so it works out somehow.

That’s the undercurrent plot carrying the drama. The surface level plot is a bunch of politicking over the company
(which is very valuable at this point), local elections, and a corrupt labour union.

Oh, right, and the story ostensibly takes place on Mars, which is otherwise an entirely irrelevant detail. There’s
essentially no mention of the terraforming that it would have taken to get Mars to the highly livable state it’s shown
in. But hey, Mars is cool.

Unfortunately, it really has no time for any of this, the drama is mostly carried by a few scenes in the last couple
episodes, and a good portion of Iris’s characterization is presented via a slideshow in the ED (which is admittedly
somehow really effective at developing her relationship with Mizuki). There is essentially nothing fleshing it out at
all, the consequences of the drama are not elaborated on, and once it finishes setting up all the requisite backstory to
get you invested in the love triangle it just sort of ends. In spite of being the driving force behind the story Iris
appears so little that I realized while writing this I don’t actually have any screenshots of her, but take my word for
it that she’s really cute.

The strength is that the character writing is very good. In spite of the relatively little time allotted to most of the
characters they’re all pretty endearing and I at least got fairly invested in their little school/child labour rocket
sweatshop. Besides the MC, Iris, Mizuki, and Kaito (the teacher) none of them really do anything of note though, they’re
just kind of there building rockets. But their discussions with each other, about rockets and just random banter, are
really nice and they’re characterized very efficiently. I don’t really know how else to describe it besides endearing.

Also, personally I just really like rockets and media that involves building rockets so that helps a lot.

Disappointingly it doesn’t go into much (really any) detail about engineering, and these aren’t really real rockets
they’re super efficient fantasy rockets. Please do not get the impression this is even remotely hard sci-fi. But hey,
it’s the thought that counts? Look, it’s enough to have scenes like this:

The one character it does actually devote a good amount of time to is Mizuki, and I think this was a good choice given
the limited runtime. Simply put, she’s just really cute and you can’t help but love her. Getting you emotionally
invested in her is a good choice to make the drama later on sort of hit in spite of how little it is actually
explicated. Mizuki and her relationship with Iris are fleshed out well enough that you can kind of imagine how a better
and longer show would go. But that’s kind of what I mean by saying the show is really only a concept; it /isn’t/ the
show you want it to be but it hints at it enough that you can imagine how the better show would go. This mostly just
left me kind of irritated at the unfulfilled potential. I think a much longer show with the same concept and character
dynamics could be really good, but the show we got is just a prototype.

The rest of the show is pretty unremarkable. The politics and intrigue were honestly pretty OK? I think most of it was
conceptually not a super interesting thing to focus on but it was executed well. I’m not even sure why the runtime felt
so short, exactly, since I don’t think it overly focused on any one aspect, I think it was just a far too ambitious show
for 13 episodes. The way the twists and revelations are presented at the end is fairly cool at least.

The MC was also fairly weak, IMO, at least compared to the girls anyway. He’s presented as this very stoic guy at the
beginning and is actively antagonistic to the teacher and other students (as he is somewhat forced to be due to his
orders from above) but then never really opens up much with the exception of one scene with Mizuki. At risk of sounding
like a character development addict I think he could’ve been a cool guy if he got a bit more development. It kind of
felt like it was setting up for that, to move him from kind of an annoying asshole at the beginning to a sympathetic
character later on with deep ties to the heroines, but that never really happened. To be clear, you do move from
disliking him to feeling kind of bad for him, but this is more due to revelations that other characters were just kind
of evil rather than to any actions from the MC. In spite of being presented as this giga successful scheming business
figure he’s honestly pretty passive in the character relationships. His secretary was pretty good though.

Overall I think the plot could’ve made for a cool revenge story if it were longer. It kind of reminded me of Hello Lady
in some ways, like I think the MC even said なすべきことをなす or something. Unfortunately not every MC can be Narita
Sinri. This show particularly would have benefitted a lot from a Narita Sinri MC; I think that’s kind of the type it was
going for and didn’t succeed at.
* Ⅲ.
Classroom☆Crisis is a prototype of a great show, but it’s not really a great show. Some of the episodes barely flow into
each other and you often just kind of have to trust that the characters have good motivations for the things they do and
it’s just not shown. Once it finally presents its core idea it really is a great idea for a story, but then it just kind
of ends. Making it twice as long might help, but I’m not even sure it wants to be in the anime medium; I think it would
make a cooler eroge than an anime.

That said, I think it’s a pretty interesting thing to watch and I don’t want it to languish in obscurity. For all its
faults I do feel some connection to what it was trying to do, and it left me hungry for a better version of itself.

Classroom☆Crisis is less of a story and more of an idea for a story, but it’s a damn good idea.
