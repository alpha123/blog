* I.
/Planetes/ is a Greek word meaning ‘wanderer’; as one might expect it is also the source of the word ‘planet’—wandering
stars.

The etymology of /planetes/ itself is somewhat obscure; most likely it derives from the Proto‑Indo‑European /*pleh₂/
referring to wide, flat areas. This would, circuitously, make it cognate with the modern English word ‘floor’ via
Proto‑Germanic /*flōraz/ meaning floor or ground.

Which is to say, Planetes is a very grounded anime.

This is, of course, just a bit of etymological sleight of hand. But the point remains true: Planetes takes an inherently
speculative premise and (ironically for a show about space) handles it in an extremely down-to-earth way. The technology
is all very well-researched but even more than that the social and political factors and motivations for space
development are all throughly explored and never once did I think “hm this seems like a bit of a stretch”. It feels all
the more prescient considering the show aired in 2003-2004, shortly after the beginning of the ISS era and well before
the current age of private space companies such as SpaceX, Axiom Space, Varda Space Industries, etc, many of which are
literally working on the things in the show and it’s not at all hard to imagine a corporation like Technora (the main
corporation in Planetes) developing out of the current private space landscape.

The sheer depth of its world irresistably draws you in to it. I think one of the greatest things fiction can achieve is
making you want to live in its world. Like how Japan seems really nice in anime, and thereby we have weebs, Planetes
manages to make you a weeb for Planetes.

To some extent I think everything tries this, but Planetes really succeeds at it. In spite of focusing on a relatively
small cast of characters you still get the sense that the world is really big and other things are happening in it, and
millions and billions of people are living their lives out there and we are so privileged to get a window into a few of
them.

And what a window we get, not just into their lives but directly into their minds. All the characters feel like they
have reasons for doing the things they do and believing the things they believe, and when that inevitably brings them
into conflict you can feel that they're both right, and they're both wrong, and how most conflicts are not really the
result of evil but just the result of having more than one person in the world and the inevitable friction that causes.
It's really good at getting you in the characters' heads and that makes their suffering and their determination and
their joy all the more poignant.

Just as an example of how much thought is put into not only its speculative technology but particularly the social and
political and human factors affected by said technology, there's one episode fairly early on where an engineer from a
third world country (which have it really rough in the Planetes world) is attempting to sell his product to a major
international corporation; without any spoilers I thought the way this went down was really realistic, from the rampant
corruption and war in his native country, to the first world countries discriminating against whether he could actually
make something good, to the brain drain from all the smart people in his native country getting out, to the actual
manufacturing operation itself taking place out of a run down warehouse manned by some really smart and dedicated people
and their optimism that they really could make things better for themselves and their country. It kind of reminded me a
bit of some article I read about a drone delivery company in Rwanda or something. Even heavily dysfunctional countries
have some really capable people and I thought it was a very well-thought-out portrayal of that as well as of the general
gap between rich countries and poor countries irl too. A lot of the most capable people from poor countries end up
immigrating to richer countries and have mixed feelings about it since they know this doesn't really help their native
country but it's the best decision for them. Is this good? Is it bad? It doesn't really take a side but just explores
how situations like this impact individual people. This is a recurring theme with Planetes.
* II.
Of course, I don’t think realism is a useful end goal in and of itself. Rather it’s just a springboard to use to use to
advance the themes of the show, which deal directly with the real world and the degree to which the show is grounded in
reality directly enhances how thought-provoking it is. This part is difficult to discuss without getting into spoilers;
if you don't want to be spoiled on the show you can skip to section [[III.][III.]] below for some final thoughts.

* III.
** writing really good
no wasted time, both within episodes and the content of each episode ties together really well and some things that were
the crux of an episode earlier come back again later as important background for something else
** post bubble japan
nostalgia for an era that im not even really sure if it was real or not
