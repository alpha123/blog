<i>Planetes</i> is a Greek word meaning ‘wanderer’; as one might expect it is also the source of the word ‘planet’—wandering
stars.
</p>

<p>
The etymology of <i>planetes</i> itself is somewhat obscure; most likely it derives from the Proto‑Indo‑European <i>*pleh₂</i>
referring to wide, flat areas. This would, circuitously, make it cognate with the modern English word ‘floor’ via
Proto‑Germanic <i>*flōraz</i> meaning floor or ground.
</p>

<p>
Which is to say, Planetes is a very grounded anime.
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, just a bit of etymological sleight of hand. But the point rings true: Planetes takes an inherently
speculative premise and (ironically for a show about space) handles it in an extremely down-to-earth way. The technology
is all very well-researched but even more than that the social and political factors and motivations for space
development are all throughly explored and never once did I think “hm this seems like a bit of a stretch”. It feels all
the more prescient considering the show aired in 2003-2004, shortly after the beginning of the ISS era and well before
the current era of private space companies such as SpaceX, Axiom Space, Varda Space Industries, etc, many of which are
literally working on the things in the show and it’s not at all hard to imagine a corporation like Technora (the main
corporation in Planetes) developing out of the current private space landscape.

The sheer depth of the world irresistably draws you in to it. I think one of the greatest things fiction can achieve is
making you want to live in its world. Like how Japan seems really nice in anime, and thereby we have weebs, Planetes
manages to make you a weeb for Planetes.

Of course, I don’t think realism is a useful end goal in and of itself. Rather it’s just a springboard to use to
